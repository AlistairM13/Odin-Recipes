    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love the flavor and lack of kitchen cleanup that occurs whenever we fire up our favorite grill recipes, like Carne Asada Tacos, my favorite Grilled Chicken, or Grilled Pizzas!</p>
    <p>I have several grill master influences in my life and there’s one thing I’ve come to learn from all of them: there’s a standard procedure to follow when firing up the grill, and if you follow it, you’ll have great results every single time!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Rib Eye Steaks, thin-cut (or uses your preferred steak)</li>
        <li>Steak Seasoning, to taste</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, if needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the steaks from the refrigerator 15-30 minutes before grilling to allow them to come to room temperature. Season steaks about 10-15 minutes before grilling and preheat your grill to medium-high heat (about 450-500 degrees F.)</li>
        <li>Place steaks on hot, well oiled grill. Cover with grill lid and cook for 3-4 minutes, (or more, depending on the thickness of the steak). Flip steaks, cover with lid, and cook an additional 3-4 minutes or until firm around the edges and slightly tender in the center. Use a thermometer to reach your desired doneness (for example, a few degrees shy of 130 degrees F for medium rare). Don't overcook!</li>
        <li>Transfer to a plate or cutting board, cover, and allow to rest for 5-10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
        <li>Store leftover steak in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.</li>
    </ol>
